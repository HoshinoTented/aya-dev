Error: The 3rd and the 4th clauses are not confluent because we failed to unify
         suc (addN (suc b) a)
         (Normalized: suc (suc (addN a b)))
       and
         suc (addN (suc a) b)
         (Normalized: suc (suc (addN b a)))
       In particular, we failed to unify
         b
       with
         a
