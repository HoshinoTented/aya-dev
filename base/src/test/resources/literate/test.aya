--| Some preload definitions:

open data Nat : Set | zero | suc Nat

--| Lately, Daylily told me an interesting problem about Aya's pattern unification.
--| Consider this function (some parameters renamed from the test suites):

def wow {U : Type} {T : U -> Type} (A B : U) (x : T A) (y : T B) : Nat => zero

--| `wow` has two implicit parameters, and note that the second one is a higher one (it is of a function type).
--| To test the parser, here's the type of `wow`: `ty:wow`.
