Some preload definitions:
data Nat : Set lp
  | zero
  | suc (_ : Nat)
open Nat hiding ()
Lately, Daylily told me an interesting problem about Aya's pattern unification.
Consider this function (some parameters renamed from the test suites):
def wow {U : Type lp lp} {T : Pi (_ : U) -> Type lp lp} (A : U) (B : U) (x : T A) (y : T B) : Nat => zero
`wow` has two implicit parameters, and note that the second one is a higher one (it is of a function type).
